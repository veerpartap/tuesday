You are happily working on something, and find the changes in these files are in good order.
¬You do not want to see them when you run "git diff", because you plan to work on other files and
changes with these files are distracting.

Somebody asks you to pull, and the changes sounds worthy of merging.

However, you already dirtied the index (i.e. your index does not match the HEAD commit).
But you know the pull you are going to make does not affect frotz.c nor filfre.c,
so you revert the index changes for these two files. Your changes in working tree remain there.

Then you can pull and merge, leaving frotz.c and filfre.c changes still in the working tree.
